      <h2>A Shade Born from Real Heat</h2>

      <p>
        The idea for ReflectaShade came to me during a Sunday at church. I was sitting under a standard canopy,
        sweating in the heat, and I realized — this thing’s doing almost nothing. It felt hotter under the shade than
        out in the open. That’s when it hit me: what if a canopy could actually reflect the heat instead of trapping it?
      </p>
      <p>
        With a baby girl on the way and being the provider for my family, I knew I had to chase this idea. I didn’t come
        from much — both of my parents didn’t finish high school, and I was the first in my family to graduate. I’ve always
        carried that pressure to be “the successful one,” and now I’m building something that can actually help people.
      </p>
      <p>
        ReflectaShade is more than a product. It’s about comfort, protection, and presence. My time as an EMT showed me
        how dangerous the sun can really be — not just discomfort, but dehydration, burns, even long-term damage. Whether
        it’s first responders needing shade in disaster zones, or parents protecting their kids at a backyard BBQ, I want
        ReflectaShade to serve them all.

      <p>This brand is for everyone — built to feel premium, built to last, and built with heart.</p>
