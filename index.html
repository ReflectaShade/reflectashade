      <h2>A shade born from real heat</h2>
      <img src="founders.jpg" alt="Founders of ReflectaShade" class="founder-photo" />
      <p>The idea for ReflectaShade came to me during a Sunday at church. I was sitting under a standard canopy, sweating in the heat, and I realized — this thing’s doing almost nothing. It felt hotter under the shade than out in the open. That’s when it hit me: what if a canopy could actually reflect the heat instead of trapping it?</p>
      <p>With a baby girl on the way and being the provider for my family, I knew I had to chase this idea. I didn’t come from much — both of my parents didn’t finish high school, and I was the first in my family to graduate. I’ve always carried that pressure to be “the successful one,” and now I’m building something that can actually help people.</p>
      <p>ReflectaShade is more than a product. It’s about comfort, protection, and presence. My time as an EMT showed me how dangerous the sun can really be — not just discomfort, but dehydration, burns, even long-term damage. Whether it’s first responders needing shade in disaster zones, or parents protecting their kids at a backyard BBQ, I want ReflectaShade to serve them all.</p>
      <p>This brand is for everyone — built to feel premium, built to last, and built with heart.</p>
